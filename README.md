# 🚚 Supply Chain & Logistics Optimization (Power BI)

This project delivers a complete analytical solution built with Power BI to support the monitoring and optimization of supply chain and logistics operations. This version is adapted to a European context, using simulated data for major cities such as Lisbon, Madrid, Berlin, Paris, and Rome, and transport providers operating in Europe, including DHL, DPD, GLS, and Chronopost It integrates data from ERP systems, WMS platforms, and carrier APIs, enabling an end-to-end view of the logistics flow — from supplier to final customer delivery. Through interactive dashboards and analytical intelligence, it enables:

✅ Reduction of operational costs

✅ Improved delivery efficiency

✅ Prevention of stockouts

✅ Evaluation of supplier and carrier performance

✅ Faster response to critical logistics events

## 🔍 Key Features

Real-time geospatial analysis with Azure Maps or ArcGIS; Strategic KPI calculations using DAX (e.g., OTIF, Inventory Turnover, Lead Time); Robust ETL using Power Query to combine multiple data sources; Automated alerts for logistics failures or critical stock levels.

## 📊 Included Dashboards

Overview – Key KPIs and time-based performance trends;Logistics Map – Warehouse locations, routes, and delivery status;Inventory Management – Coverage analysis, turnover, and stock alerts;Supplier Performance – Ranking and SLA compliance trends.
